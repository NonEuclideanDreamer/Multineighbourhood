# Multineighbourhood
Cellular Automaton changing its own Rules

To get started, create a java project containing all these classes.
Neighbourhood.java contains the main method. Running it will produce a series of png-files that can be put together to a video.
Changing the first 3 values in the class body should already give you some variety in the output. (Carefull, big n will make the code very slow).
Changing the type of neighbourhoods, the multiplicity of state values and other values will require more careful changes, I will update, when I get around to them.
If you try yourself, feel free to ask questions, for example on discord: https://discord.gg/QXpym94dwV
